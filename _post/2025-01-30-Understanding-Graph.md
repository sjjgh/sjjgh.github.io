# what is graph
After I started working more closely with machine learning, I read and reviewed many papers related to graphs.

Many of them felt a bit odd to me—not because they were wrong, but because they often focused on inventing increasingly sophisticated tricks on graphs, without clearly explaining the intuition behind them.

Coming from a mathematics and physics background, I tend to care more about the reasoning behind a phenomenon than about engineering a black-box method. To me, good intuition usually comes from first asking a more fundamental question: what is a graph, and how should we interpret it in the context of machine learning?

During the first several years of my PhD, I spent a lot of time playing with graphs and embedding methods. Along the way, I gradually formed some perspectives that I rarely saw discussed explicitly. I felt they were worth writing down—and this blog is an attempt to do exactly that.
